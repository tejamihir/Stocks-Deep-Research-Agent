# Finnova AI – RAG-powered Equity Research Assistant

Finnova AI is an intelligent financial research application that provides **actionable, ticker-level insights** on U.S. equities (currently scoped to S&P 500). It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to ground LLM responses in real-time market and fundamentals data, reducing hallucinations while enabling explainable outputs.

## Core Components

- **Data Ingestion & Retrieval**  
  Fetches real-time/historical market data, fundamentals, and news via external APIs. Normalizes and indexes into a **vector store** for semantic retrieval of company-specific context (price history, key ratios, business descriptions).

- **RAG Workflow**  
  Query → **Retriever** selects top-k relevant financial documents → Injects into LLM prompt → Generates grounded, evidence-based answers.

- **Analytics Layer**  
  Python-based computations for return statistics, factor-style metrics, and cross-ticker comparisons (S&P 500 scope).

- **Application Layer**  
  **Streamlit** frontend with interactive querying, session state management, and dual-display of NL answers + retrieved context (tables, charts, sources).
